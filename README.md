# PID Controller circuit

## Aim
To Design and simulate PID Controller circuit using Operational Amplifier in NgSpice software

## Working
pamp  as  inverting  amplifier  is  used  tocalculate  the  proportional  term,  op-amp  as  a  differentiatoris  used  to  calculate  the  derivative  term.  An  op-amp  as  anintegrator is used to calculate the integral term. The value of K<sub>P<sub>, K<sub>D<sub> & K<sub>I<sub> depends on the respective op-amp gain. Theseterms are added using an op-amp as summer, followed by aninverting op-amp to compensate for the inversion caused dueto the circuit.
